#### Description

This directory is home to an exploratory data analysis of the 2013 [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://cdc.gov/brfss) data that was provided to students of the Coursera course, [Introduction to Probability and Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro/home/info), taught by Duke University. 
 
To see the output of my EDA, please see either the markdown output (`intro_data_prob_project.md`) file or the
html output file (`intro_data_prob_project.html`).
